# DSA-practice
This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems** that I solve using **Python**.
I will keep adding more problems over time, so the topics may change or grow.

##  What’s inside
This repo has Python files with my problem solutions.  
I organize them in folders by topic (like arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) when I add them.
